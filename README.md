Author: Dave Li dave@deckbird.ai

WebMPF (Web Multimodal Presentation Format), also known as Smart Video, is a new Internet open standard for web based presentation curating and sharing. When this version is completed, it will be submitted to IETF for RFC.

WebMPF works with PDF files, images, music, and videos as the building blocks to ensure maximum compatibilities, while utilize zero-shot cross lingual AI voice models and compartmental localized LLMs for personalized curating and sharing.

WebMPF is designed to be: 

* File Agnostic. Smart video works with PDF files, texts, images, audio, and video as the building block. Those content can be users generated or AI generated.

* Multimodal. Smart video incorporates text, images, audio, and video to deliver a rich media experience.

* Faster. Smart video is optimized for content streaming and delivery over the Internet. It is significantly faster than video and PDF file.

* Eliminates the slide-to-video barrier. Anyone can produce a smart video, if they know how to create a slide presentation. At the same time, it gives user full control of the generated contents.

* Fundamentally changes the way presentations are delivered. The audience are no longer “reading” slides, instead they are “watching” a smart video. 

* Fundamentally changes the way presentations are created. Presentations are no longer limited to text and images, it becomes multimodal with voice and video. 

* API framework that allows third-party developers to develop tools and plugins, fostering a developer community and eco-system.
