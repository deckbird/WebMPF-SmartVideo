WebMPF: Web Multimodal Presentation Format 

WebMPF (Web Multimodal Presentation Format), also known as Smart Video, is a new Internet open standard for presentation curating and sharing.

WebMPF works with PDF files, images, and videos as the building blocks to ensure maximum compatibilities, while utilize zero-shot cross lingual AI voice models and compartmental localized LLMs for personalized curating and sharing.

WebMPF is designed to be: 

* File Agnostic. Smart video works with PDF files, texts, images, audio, and video as the building block. Those content can be users generated or AI generated.

* Multimodal. Smart video incorporates text, images, audio, and video to deliver a rich media experience.

* Faster. Smart video is optimized for content streaming and delivery. It is significantly faster than video and PDF file.

* Eliminates the slide-to-video barrier. Anyone can produce a smart video, if they know how to create a slide presentation. At the same time, it gives user full control of the generated contents.

* Fundamentally changes the way presentations are delivered. The audience are no longer “reading” slides, instead they are “watching” a smart video. 

* Fundamentally changes the way presentations are created. Presentations are no longer limited to text and images, it becomes multimodal with voice and video. 

* API framework that allows third-party developers to develop tools and plugins, fostering a developer community and eco-system.
